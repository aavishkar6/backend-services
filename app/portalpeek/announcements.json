If so, have you ever thought the designs you generate using LLMs may contain a backdoor or a trojan? If this intrigues you then you should try out the AI-based Hardware Attack Challenge(AHA) challenge ofCSAW'24. In this challenge, you put on your attacker hat and use LLMs to insert hardware vulnerabilities in the commonly used open-source digital designs. The vulnerabilities must be simulatable and synthesizable, and you will need to be able to demonstrate the effects of the added vulnerability (e.g Hardware CWE & CVSS score). A successful submission will need to include all prompts and responses from the language model, a document detailing your methodology, and detailed demonstrations of exploits. You may use and modify existing tools and frameworks as you see fit. Points will be awarded for subtle yet powerful exploits, creative AI usage, tool integration, and valid use-cases. You can find further details about the challenge here(link).
